# NLP_BoW_sklrn_Tweets_Sentiment_Analysis

Applied Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis with Python
In this Notebook, I'm applying the following concepts/tools to build a model that is able to do a Sentiment Analysis on a dataset of tweets:

**Text Normalization**

using Text Mining techniques and some suitable libraries like NLTK.

The following tasks are applied on the tweets:

Tokenization
Stemming
Lemmatization
**Text Representation**

using Text Representation techniques:

* BoW

* TF-IDF

**ML Modelling**

using Scikit-Learn.

P.S. The model first performs all the necessary cleaning tasks.

Case-study:
Given the dataset of tweets, we're going to build a NLP model that would be able to predict whether a tweet is postivie or negative.
